Notes on computing time:

the computing time is at work about: 27iterations/minute for 3 regressors and an
intercept. Convergence occurs fast so one can, in principal, use FOR MODELS WITH
INTERCEPT AND JUST PRICES M=5000 or even lower to at least check the signs of
the effects of prices on shares.

101_DEPRECATED_....:
due to new data available: Zsuzsanna merged everything into one dataset
