simulations with 5 states: test of performance

- if phi is high like for phi_xa1=0.8, then there is lots of correlation in the traces of parameters of that state 
- if phi is small like for phi_xa2-5=0.5, then there is not much correlation in the traces of parameters of that state and results look really nice
